### Questions:
#
# When is the burning? Does it occurr as the heavens are opened and Christ is
# revealed and he comes down with the saints?
#
# What is the interpretation of the natural disasters in the sixth seal? Are they
# concurrent with the restoration, before it, or after it?
# 
# When is the gathering at Adam-Ondi-Ahman? 
# 
# When is the temple built in New Jerusalem?
# Read more about Mount Zion (New Jerusalem)
#
# When is the temple built in Jerusalem?
# 
# When do the islands become one land?
#
# What is the "great sign in heaven?" Is it Christ coming in the clouds? Or the unrolling
# of heaven as a scroll? Or something else?
#
# What is the order of Christ's appearances? I have scriptures saying he comes in the clouds
# before standing on Mount Olive and others saying the reverse.
#
# Does Christ come in the clouds immediately after the heaven is unrolled as a scroll?
# I.e. does it open so that he can return? Or is it a separate event?
# Does the burning happen right after the unrolling and his presence is on the whole earth?
# Revelations says the heaven is unrolled as a scroll in the sixth seal, but Christ
# returns in the seventh seal.
#
# Is the seventh angel in the seventh seal (seven thunders; mystery of God finished) the same
# as the "Angel sounds his trump?"
#
# What is the relationship, in terms of timing, between the Burning and the Great earthquake?
#
### Resolved Questions
#
# Is the quickening of saints to meet Christ in the clouds the same as the morning of
# the First Resurrection? 
#     Yes.
#
# Ezekial says Gog and Magog are defeated in the plains outside Israel whereas
# Zechariah says half of Jerusalem is taken captive. How do we reconcile that?
#     The city is taken captive but the army is later defeated on the plains.
#
# Is the "gathering of God's people," "the gathering of the elect," and "the gathering of saints
# from the four quarters of the earth" all the same thing?
#     I believe that the "gathering of the remainder of the elect" (JST M 1:37) and the gathering of God's people (3 Nephi 21:24)
#     are likely the same (since they seem to happen shortly before Christ comes in the clouds) and they are part of the larger
#     gathering of Israel that happens more broadly throughout the duration of the latter-days (beginning with the restoration).
