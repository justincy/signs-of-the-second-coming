This page is the product of an ongoing study about the signs of the times.
The primary objective is to put the signs in order. <em>We are not trying
to predict when the Second Coming will occur.</em>

This analysis is from the perspective of the teachings of The Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

## How are the charts created?

We start with analyzing a passage of scripture and listing relationships
between signs. For example, in [Revelation 8:1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rev/8.1?lang=eng) we read:

> And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour.

From that we extract the following relationship:

```
"Opening of the Seventh Seal" -> "Silence in heavens for half an hour"
```

We continue that process for all scriptures that tell us about the order
of any signs. Then we feed the list into a computer process that automatically
generates a chart for us.
