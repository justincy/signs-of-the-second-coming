I would love to have help with this analysis!

## Analyzing Scriptures

I haven't analyzed all scriptures which mention signs of the Second Coming and I don't claim that my current 
analysis is without error. You could help by analyzing additional scriptures or reviewing the scriptures I
have already analyzed. The [full list of signs](/references/) is annotated with scripture references and is
ordered according to the common ordering of scriptures (OT, NT, BoM, D&C, PoGP).

There are two methods I have found helpful for analyzing scriptures:

1. Review an entire passage and extract all the relationships between signs from it. This works well for
large passages like D&C 88 or many chapters of Revelation which mention many signs.
2. Review all scriptures which mention a particular sign. For example, you might review all the verses listed
in the Topical Guide under [Israel, Gathering of](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/tg/israel-gathering-of) or search (via the app or website) for [trump of God](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/search?lang=eng&query=trump%20of%20god&facet=scriptures).

## Identifying Synonyms

The [full chart](/charts/full) is too complicated. One easy way to simplify the chart is to identify and
merge synonyms. We have a [list of synonyms](https://github.com/justincy/signs-of-the-second-coming/blob/master/synonyms/synonyms.gv) that have already been identified. There are also [notes](https://github.com/justincy/signs-of-the-second-coming/tree/master/synonyms) about some synonyms that required research. 
You can help with identify more synonyms by reviewing the [simplified chart](/charts/simplified/) to
find signs that seem similar. You may also review a [list of possibilities](https://github.com/justincy/signs-of-the-second-coming/tree/master/synonyms).

## Creating Visualizations

The charts help visualize the complexity of the data, and even though we generate a simplified carth, it still
isn't simple enough. We have a list of [existing ideas](https://github.com/justincy/signs-of-the-second-coming/issues) for enhancing the existing charts or creating new visualizations. You could help us brianstorm additional
ideas or help implement our current ideas.
