## Analyzing Scriptures

I haven't analyzed all scriptures which mention signs of the Second Coming and I don't claim that my current 
analysis is without error. You could help by analyzing additional scriptures or reviewing the scriptures I
have already analyzed. The [full list of signs](signs/signs.gv) is annotated with scripture references and is ordered according to the common ordering of scriptures (OT, NT, BoM, D&C, PoGP).

There are two methods I have found helpful for analyzing scriptures:

1. Review an entire passage and extract all the relationships between signs from it. This works well for
large passages like D&C 88 or many chapters of Revelation which mention many signs.
2. Review all scriptures which mention a particular sign. For example, you might review all the verses listed
in the Topical Guide under "Israel, Gathering of" or search (via the app or website) for "trump of God."

Send me a note about any additions or changes I should make via the Feedback link in the footer or via an
issue or pull request in GitHub.
