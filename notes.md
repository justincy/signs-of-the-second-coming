I want to make the simplified graph more understandable. I realized that many signs are not in strict
order. What I mean is, sometimes they point to things which happen a few steps later and skip signs
between them. For example, many signs point to "Christ comes in the clouds" because it's the actual
Second Coming, but they could point to "Heaven unrolled as a scroll" or "Face of the Lord unveiled"
(assuming those immediately precede before "Christ comes in the clouds").

I think that I'd like to have a way to specify generic modifications, similar ot how I specify synonyms.
I don't want to manually modify the full signs.gv graph; I want that to represent the scriptures as
closely as possible without interpretation.
