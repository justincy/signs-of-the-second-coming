I need to review "Angel sounds his trump" to decide whether all instances are describing the same event.
Thes scriptures describe many different instances of an angel sounding a trump. I may have incorrectly
assume that single instances of it were all the same.

I think that I'd like to have a way to specify generic modifications, similar ot how I specify synonyms.
I don't want to manually modify the full signs.gv graph; I want that to represent the scriptures as
closely as possible without interpretation.

Study Joel 2 in detail.
