I need to review "Angel sounds his trump" to decide whether all instances are describing the same event.
Thes scriptures describe many different instances of an angel sounding a trump. I may have incorrectly
assume that single instances of it were all the same.

Study Joel 2 in detail.

Review the rest of 1 Nephi 22. Nephi doesn't explicitly state
a -> b relationships among all the signs, but he does seem to discuss
them in an order that matches other verses. We'll need to see if they
line up, or if we just wait until we can associate scriptures with
signs even when there's no relationship.

Consider gathering of the wheat as a synonym for gathering of Israel or gathering of the elect.
Study the separation of the wheat from the tares

Review D&C 87.

It seems likely that all natural/physical signs occur before and end with the Sign of the Son of Man.

Review 2 Nephi 6 & 12

The word "Restoration" likely isn't used in the Book of Mormon. Review instances of it in the graph
and replace with other scriptural phrases which are synonyms for the restoration.

This passage of scripture doesn't give enough context to 
put any signs in order. It's just listing different signs.
