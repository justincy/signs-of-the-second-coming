# Signs of the Second Coming

Exploring the order of the signs of the Second Coming of Christ as mentioned in scripture.
This analysis is published at https://www.greatdayofthelord.org/ and is from the perspective
of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

The primary purpose is to identify the order of the signs. _We are not trying to predict when
Christ will return._

## How it works

[DOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language)) is used to describe 
relationships between signs. [Graphiz](https://www.graphviz.org/) is used to generate the charts.

A complete [list of signs](signs/signs.gv) is maintained that we try not to add any interpretation to.
A simplified chart is generated by removing duplicate edges from the graph and by processing a
list of [synonyms](synonyms/synonyms.gv) (the sign on the left is merged into the sign on the right).

There is a list of [questions](questions.md) regarding the current analysis and notes on a few [synonyms](./synonyms).

The website is generated with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).
