# Signs of the Second Coming

Exploring the order of the signs of the Second Coming of Christ as mentioned in scripture.
I use [DOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language)) to describe 
relationships between signs and then visualize it with either an [online](https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline/) 
tool or a local [VS Code plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=joaompinto.vscode-graphviz).

I maintain a complete list of signs that I try not to add any interpretation to.

I also maintain a list of synonyms which I use to generate a simplified version of the graph.

I have a list of [questions](questions.md) regarding my current analysis and notes on various [synonyms](./synonyms).

I generate a static website with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) that is deployed at https://www.greatdayofthelord.org/.
