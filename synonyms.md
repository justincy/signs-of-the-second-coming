## "Moon turned to blood" and "Moon darkened"

The two different phrases seem very different initiatlly. "Turned to blood" implies the moon turned red in color while "darkened" seems to imply it was totally darkened like a new moon or ecplise. But perhaps they're the same. The moon turns red during lunar eclipses when sunlight is reflected off of the earth; that's much darker than direct sunlight.

  - For the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light; the sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and the *moon shall not cause her light to shine*.

## "Christ comes in the clouds," "Great sign in heaven," and "Sign of the Son of Man"

| Sign | Before | After |
----- | ---- | ----
| Christ comes in the clouds | Mount of Olives splits; Gentiles help gather God's people; Jews gathered in Jerusalem; Morning of the First Resurrection; Rapture; Sign of the Son of Man; Gathering of the remainder of the elect; Sun darkened; Moon turned to blood; Stars refuse their light; Stars fall from heaven; Signs in Heavens; Wars | Burning; Christ reigns as king |
| Great sign in heaven | Stars fall from heaven; sun darkened; Moon turned to blood; Thunderings, lightenings, tempests, tsunamis; Earthquakes | Silence for half an hour; Curtain of heaven unfolded as a scroll |
| Sign of the Son of Man | Moon darkened; Stars fall from heaven; Heavens shake; Sun darkened | Christ comes in the clouds |

I'm pretty sure that "Great sign in heaven" and "Sign of the Son of Man" are the same. However I'm not sure that "Christ comes in the clouds" is the same. It seems that a sign may be given before he actually appears. My main reason for believing this is that JST Matthew 1:36 seems to imply that Christ comes in the clouds _after_ the sign is given.

![Relationship between "Christ comes in the clouds", "Great sign in heaven", and "Sign of the Son of Man"](img/christ-in-the-clouds.png)

The "sign of the son of man" is only referred to in Matthew 24 (and JST Matthew 1).
The "great sign in heaven" is referred to in Revelation 12:1 and D&C 88.

JST Revelation 12:1 refers to the "great sign in heaven" as being "a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars." But it also says that the sign was "in the likeness of things on the earth." John is describing his vision which is symbolic and not necessarily literal. Also, he's talking about the apostasy and war in heaven, not the second coming. So I don't believe this is the same sign as the one being described in D&C 88 which clearly is related to the second coming.

Therefore, we're left with the "sign of the son of man" in Matthew 24 (JST Matthew 1) and the "great sign in heaven" in D&C 88.
