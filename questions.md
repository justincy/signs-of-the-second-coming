* What is the "sign of the Son of Man?" Is it Christ coming in the clouds? Or the unrolling
of heaven as a scroll? Or something else?

    Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, p287: "But what will the world do? They will say
    it is a planet, a comet, etc. But the Son of Man will come as the sign of the coming of
    the Son of Man, which will be as a light of the morning coming out of the east.

* Does Christ come in the clouds immediately after the heaven is unrolled as a scroll?
I.e. does it open so that he can return? Or is it a separate event?
Does the burning happen right after the unrolling and his presence is on the whole earth?
Revelations says the heaven is unrolled as a scroll in the sixth seal, but Christ
returns in the seventh seal.

# Resolved Questions

* Is the quickening of saints to meet Christ in the clouds the same as the morning of
the First Resurrection? 
     
    Yes.

* Ezekial says Gog and Magog are defeated in the plains outside Israel whereas
Zechariah says half of Jerusalem is taken captive. How do we reconcile that?
     
    The city is taken captive but the army is later defeated on the plains.

* Is the "gathering of God's people," "the gathering of the elect," and "the gathering of saints
from the four quarters of the earth" all the same thing?
     
    I believe that the "gathering of the remainder of the elect" (JST M 1:37) and the gathering of God's people (3 Nephi 21:24)
    are likely the same (since they seem to happen shortly before Christ comes in the clouds) and they are part of the larger
    gathering of Israel that happens more broadly throughout the duration of the latter-days (beginning with the restoration).

* What is the "great day of the Lord?" Is it the same as "Christ comes in the clouds?"

    Yes.
