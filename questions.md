# Resolved Questions

* Is the quickening of saints to meet Christ in the clouds the same as the morning of
the First Resurrection? 
     
    Yes.

* Ezekial says Gog and Magog are defeated in the plains outside Israel whereas
Zechariah says half of Jerusalem is taken captive. How do we reconcile that?
     
    The city is taken captive but the army is later defeated on the plains.

* Is the "gathering of God's people," "the gathering of the elect," and "the gathering of saints
from the four quarters of the earth" all the same thing?
     
    I believe that the "gathering of the remainder of the elect" (JST M 1:37) and the gathering of God's people (3 Nephi 21:24)
    are likely the same (since they seem to happen shortly before Christ comes in the clouds) and they are part of the larger
    gathering of Israel that happens more broadly throughout the duration of the latter-days (beginning with the restoration).

* What is the "great day of the Lord?" Is it the same as "Christ comes in the clouds?"

    Yes.

* What is the "sign of the Son of Man?" Is it Christ coming in the clouds? Or the unrolling
of heaven as a scroll? Or something else? Does Christ come in the clouds immediately after 
the heaven is unrolled as a scroll? In other words, is heavan unrolled so that he can return?
Or is it a separate event?

    Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, p287: "But what will the world do? They will say
    it is a planet, a comet, etc. But the Son of Man will come as the sign of the coming of
    the Son of Man, which will be as a light of the morning coming out of the east.

    I believe that the sign of the Son of Man immediately follows heaving being unrollend
    and immediately precedes Christ coming in the clouds.

    See D&C 88:95-97 and JST Matthew 1:36

* When is the burning? Does it happen right after the unrolling and his presence is on the
whole earth? Revelations says the heaven is unrolled as a scroll in the sixth seal, but 
Christ returns in the seventh seal.

    D&C 101:23-25 makes it clear that it is Christ's presence, after his face is unveiled,
    that burns the corrubtible and wicked things of the earth. So it happens when heaven
    is unrolled and Christ is revealed.

* Is "Great tribulation of the Jews" the same as "All nations gathered against Israel?"

    Yes. See the [synonym notes](synonyms/jews-tribulation.md) about this.
