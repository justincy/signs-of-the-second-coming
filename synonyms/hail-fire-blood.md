Hail, fire, and blood are often mentioned together, and some scriptures seem
to indicate that they'll fall from the sky together, similar to the plague
of hail and fire that was sent to the Egyptians. In Exodus 9:22-26 it says that
hail fail and fire "ran along upon the ground" "so there was hail, and fire
mingled with the hail."
