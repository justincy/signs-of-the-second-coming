# "Moon turned to blood" and "Moon darkened"

The two different phrases seem very different initially. "Turned to blood" implies the moon turned red in color while "darkened" seems to imply it was totally darkened like a new moon or ecplise. But perhaps they're the same. The moon turns red during lunar eclipses when sunlight is reflected off of the earth; that's much darker than direct sunlight.

## Notes

Is there a symbollic connection between these prophecies and the kingdoms of glory being described as the sun, the moon, and the stars?

Different sides of the earth may see different signs. Only half the earth can see the sun at a time; only half can see the moon.
