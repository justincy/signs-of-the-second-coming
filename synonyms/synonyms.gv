# List of signs that I believe are synonyms.
#
# My reasoning for considering two signs as synonyms
# is documented elsewhere. This list is used to 
# programatically simplify the full graph by 
# collapsing synonyms.
#
# In each (a -> b) pair, the sign on the left will
# be replaced in the graph by the sign on the right.

digraph {
  "Great sign in heaven" -> "Sign of the Son of Man"

  # D&C 34:7-8
  "Great day of the Lord" -> "Christ comes in the clouds"
