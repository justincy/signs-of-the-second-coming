Are "Great tribulation of the Jews" and "All nations gathered against Israel" the same?

"All nations gathered against Israel" is a precursor to great destruction in Israel
and Jerusalem, Christ appearing on the Mount of Olives, and Armageddon. That sounds like
great tribulation to me, but I don't yet have anything connecting them. I also don't
yet have any precursors to "Great tribulation of the Jews."

Mark 13:14 seems to imply that the tribulation is the same as the abomination of
desolation. The Bible Dictionary on [Abomination of desolation](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bd/abomination-of-desolation?lang=eng) says that it means Jerusalem is under seige.
The seige of Jerusalem happens after all nations are gathered against Israel and
ends when Christ appears on the Mount of Olives. So the abomination and tribulation
could represent all signs between all nations gathered and Christ on Mount of Olives.
Which one do I choose as the synonym? The great tribulation happens before the sun is
darkened and we have all nations gathered happening before the sun is darkened, so
we'll choose that one as the synonym.
