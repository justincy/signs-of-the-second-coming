Are "Great tribulation of the Jews" and "All nations gathered against Israel" the same?

"All nations gathered against Israel" is a precursor to great destruction in Israel
and Jerusalem, Christ appearing on the Mount of Olives, and Armageddon. That sounds like
great tribulation to me, but I don't yet have anything connecting them. I also don't
yet have any precursors to "Great tribulation of the Jews."
