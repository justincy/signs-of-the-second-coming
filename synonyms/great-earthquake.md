The Great Earthquake has become problematic. The scriptures speak of many earthquakes.
Some seem to refer to a particular large earthquake while others are just earthquakes.
It's caused a cycle which is an indication that we've got something wrong.
Lets review all earthquakes and try to put them in distinct events.
